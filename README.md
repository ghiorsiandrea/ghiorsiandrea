<h3 align="left">I am an accountant who has migrated to the world 
of programming in an autodidact way and recently started my formal
studies.
In my GitHub you can see the projects in which I have been 
working to expand and be able to capture the knowledge acquired.

You will be able to appreciate that some of my projects are about 
YouTube courses (for example: "Java desde Cero - Pildoras Informaticas" in which I was able 
to acquire and apply valuable knowledge on, for example, 
Collections, Sockets.
