<h3 align="left">In this profile you can see the projects in which I have
been working in order to expand and be able to capture the knowledge
acquired.
<br>
<br>
<br>
You will be able to appreciate that some of my projects are about 
YouTube courses (for example: "Java desde Cero - Pildoras Informaticas" in which I was able 
to acquire and apply valuable knowledge on, for example, 
Collections, Sockets.
